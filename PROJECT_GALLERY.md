This project implements a pet adoption system that showcases how to build a well-structured modular application. Here are the requirements that guided the implementation:
#### Core Requirements

* **FastAPI and Uvicorn**: The application must be built using FastAPI framework and served with Uvicorn
* **REST API**: Expose a clean, RESTful API interface
* **Multiple Services**: Support multiple responsibilities through different endpoints
* **Internal Communication**: Services must communicate through their public REST API endpoints
* **Logging**: Implement a robust logging system for debugging and monitoring
* **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for routes, services, and custom functionality

#### Additional Features

* **Service Separation**: Although monolithic, the application should be designed to be easily split into microservices
* **API Documentation**: Well-defined and typed API with automatic documentation
* **Code Generation**: Auto-generated API clients from service specifications using Pydantic models
* **Modern Async**: Leverage FastAPI and AsyncIO for efficient asynchronous operations
* **Isolated Logging**: Each service maintains its own logging configuration


## [Optimization and Implicit bias - Lecture](https://github.com/YoraiLevi/Optimization_and_Dynamical_systems_Fixed_point_iterations_and_Implicit_Bias)
A lecture for dynamical systems course relating the field of optimization to fractals, computer aided maths and ultimately separability and implicit bias  
The lecture's code also includes interactive fractal/julia set explorer with python and matplotlib in jupyter notebook (runs locally)

## [An automation tool that sets posts in facebook's activity log to private,public or friends for the new 2020 design.](https://github.com/YoraiLevi/SetFacebookPostsPrivate)  
With the new decade a lot has changed, so did facebook's interface making it harder to automate interactions. This was tampermonkey script to automate post audience with configurations not allowed by facebook's own audience managment tools
